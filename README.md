# Doudizhu
This work is based on the DouZero library, so the requirements are the same as Pymarl. For convenience, code of original DouZero is also included in the project. Our modifications are listed in other folders and anyone who wants to refer to this job can refer to corresponding code. The installation and other instructons please refer to DouZero(https://github.com/kwai/DouZero). We just talk about changes we make in this project.
